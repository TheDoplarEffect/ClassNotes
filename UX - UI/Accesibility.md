Websites need to be accesible for example for colour blind people, partially visually impared or blind.


For Example, make sure to give descriptive definitions of all photos so that auto-readers can describe the image.  Rather than a single word.

This can be for the [[Choosing colours]] as well as the [[Typography]].

The [[Contrast]] is also important since not all colours will match correcty at the same size.
