## Structure

### Paragraph 

I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. Look at that text! Mark my words. They’re typists … And some, I assume, are good words. Would anyone use that?

### Headings & Code

#### Common uses
```md
[ ] Here you can see the code

## And it won't be affected.

```

#### Alternative uses
```md 
I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. It could be Russia, but it could also be China
